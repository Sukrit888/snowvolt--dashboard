# ❄️ SnowVolt Dashboard – TENG Snow Energy Monitoring

This dashboard simulates renewable energy harvesting using snow via a Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG). Designed using Python + Streamlit, with real-time logging and Power BI analytics.

## 📌 Features
- Simulated sensor data: Snow Depth, Temperature, Humidity, Energy, Battery
- CSV logging + download
- Power BI report with interactive visuals
- Product Management use case for energy monitoring in cold regions

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Streamlit, Pandas)
- Power BI (for data storytelling)
- GitHub, Colab, CSV export

## 📥 Try It Yourself
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `snowvolt_dashboard.py` via Streamlit
3. Explore `SnowVolt_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI

## 🔮 Real-world Deployment
In a physical setup, sensors + TENG will replace simulated values.
