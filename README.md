# ❄️ SnowVolt Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit-based prototype simulating renewable energy generation using **Snow Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs)**, inspired by research from UCLA.

## 🔧 Built With
- **Streamlit** for the dashboard interface
- **Plotly** for interactive visualizations
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **Mock CSV data** representing real-world TENG readings

## 🎯 Features
- KPI Metrics (Voltage, Current, Energy)
- Line charts for energy trends
- CSV download button
- Lightweight PM-friendly UI

## 🚀 To Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🌐 Live Demo
This project is designed for local simulation. A live version is available via ngrok upon request.
